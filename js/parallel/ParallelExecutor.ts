/**
 * Executes a kernel in parallel, using async/await to simulate the WGPU execution model.
 *
 * Designed so that we can test WGPU-like code, but use the debugging facilities of the browser to debug it.
 *
 * We'll randomly choose which item to execute next, so that as much as possible things are executed with a random order
 *
 * Things are structured so that execution thread functions will:
 * - await context.start() - at the very start of the call
 * - await all of the inter-thread primitives (like get/set)
 * - resolve when complete
 *
 * Thus the executor will keep ONE thread going at a time, and every time one of those actions is taken, we'll toss
 * the function to resolve that in a list (with the others), and will randomly choose which one to resolve next.
 * This will execute things with a fairly random order.
 *
 * (needs a working knowledge of the WGSL execution model to understand)
