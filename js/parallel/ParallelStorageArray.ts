/**
 * Represents a storage-level array.
 *
 * We need to track which execution threads/invocations have written to which indices, so that we can (a) ensure that
 * we won't get data races (and will have uniform control flow), and (b) in the future potentially simulate cases where
 * we might get more undefined-like behavior between which values we get.
 *
 * For storage-level arrays, we'll need to track (a) which workgroup, and (b) which local invocation within that
 * workgroup wrote to that index. When a workgroup synchronizes with storageBarrier(), it will ONLY synchronize the
 * actions that THAT SPECIFIC workgroup has done, and will leave the records of modifications from others alone.
 *
 * TODO: for NOW, we'll lock out and fail on reads (if another thread wrote), OR multiple-thread writes, HOWEVER
 * TODO: we should make it possible to return arbitrary results (and track values) for other cases
 *
 * See ParallelExecutor for more high-level documentation.
