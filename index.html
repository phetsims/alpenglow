      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Alpenglow is an experimental rasterizer that takes a scene description and efficiently produces a corresponding
        high-quality image.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to have:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A high-performance WebGPU rasterizer (<span class="text-info">in progress</span>)
        </li>
        <li>
          A software reference implementation (<span class="text-success">implemented</span>)
        </li>
        <li>
          A potential WebGL 2 fallback (<span class="text-error">not started</span>)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="overview-mainChallenges">Main Challenges</h3>

      <p>
        We are trying to solve the following problems:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Need a high-quality and high-performance way to display vector graphics (in the browser,
          and natively). In particular, we would like to avoid <a href="#overview-conflation">conflation artifacts</a>,
          <a href="#overview-aliasingGamma">anti-aliasing/gamma-blending issues</a>, and
          <a href="#overview-gradients">gradient aliasing issues</a>
          without having to resort to expensive techniques like multisampling. We'd also prefer to
          <a href="#overview-color">support wide gamut display</a>, and have finer-grained control over image
          <a href="#overview-upsampling">upsampling</a> and <a href="#overview-downsampling">downsampling</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          WebGPU/WGSL is missing a library with reusable generic parallel computation primitives (e.g. reduce/scan/sort),
          and doesn't have the abstractions built-in to easily support this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improving the processing of vector graphics primitives to efficiently solve the occlusion/overlapping problem.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id="overview-conflation">Conflation Artifacts</h4>

      <p>
        Many common approaches run into conflation artifacts (from
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="KilgardBolz2012"></span>, see
        <a href="https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/1824/what-is-illustrators-vector-rasterization-process">description</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/49">discussion</a>, and
        <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/projects/GanEtAl14/sample.html?contour">examples</a>). These are graphical
        glitches that occur when coverage is conflated with opacity, and happens in many common approaches (especially
        with compositing). The source is treating the cases "a red path at 50% opacity fully covers the area" and
        "a fully-opaque red path covers 50% of the area" as equivalent in later stages, and cases where multiple paths
        precisely join along a curve may incorrectly show the background in those pixels.
      </p>

          No artifacts (Alpenglow CPU)
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We are able to solve this problem by using a different approach based on polygonal boolean operations, where
        we can get a list of polygonal faces where each input path is either fully contained or fully
        excluded in each face. We can then use high-performance approaches to rasterize each face independently, then
        accumulate while avoiding multisampling and conflation artifacts. Often these faces will be of constant color,
        which can very efficiently be displayed (we skip the per-pixel blending with the completely-occluded background
        contents).
      </p>

      <h4 id="overview-aliasingGamma">Aliasing &amp; Gamma-Incorrect Blending</h4>

      <p>
        Aliasing is the low-frequency pattern that spuriously appears when we are displaying high-frequency content
        in a lower-resolution way. In general, we want to reduce these low-frequency patterns without overly introducing
        blurring. Basic anti-aliasing can help "smooth" things like the jagged edges of lines (e.g. with text), but
        some approaches aren't general enough to help with other types of aliasing.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be correct, blending should be done in the correct color spaces. Many applications choose to blend in
        non-linear color spaces (e.g. sRGB), which can cause blended colors to look incorrect (usually darker).
        For more information, see
        <a href="https://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/09/21/what-every-coder-should-know-about-gamma/">this reference</a>.

      </div>

      <p>
        For instance, the above checkerboards (with 3d perspective) have smooth transitions from low to high frequency.
        Note the pattern should blur to a light gray as it fades in the distance. Visible patterns are a sign of aliasing,
        and darkening of the pattern is a sign of gamma-incorrect blending.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Gradients with color stops close together (e.g. when zoomed out in a user interface) can also create many aliasing patterns.
        Alpenglow is able to compute exact analytic gradient contributions (based on the exact pixel coverage), and with
        filtering added is able to produce high-quality gradients.

      <p>
        Many gradient implementations also have issues with gradients when zoomed in, and may drop or distort gradients
        in the above cases. Gradient bands should get thinner and thinner until they look like lines.
      </p>

      <h4 id="overview-color">Color Spaces and Wide-Gamut Support</h4>

      <p>
        While gamma is critical, blending in the correct color space is also important. Blending in sRGB does not produce
        perceptually uniform colors. Colors should be converted to/from a color space meant for this purpose when
        perceptual gradients are required. <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> is great for this,
        and while not yet supported in Canvas/SVG, it can be
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklab">used in CSS</a>.
      </p>

      <div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <div class="span6 example">
          <div id="redGreenGradients-example"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 96px;"></div></div>
          Oklab, linear sRGB, and sRGB (top to bottom). Note the green bias in linear sRGB and darkening in sRGB. Oklab is perpectually uniform.
        </div>
        <div class="span6 example">
          <div id="blueWhiteGradients-example"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 96px;"></div></div>
          Oklab, linear sRGB, and sRGB (top to bottom). Note the hue shift toward purple in the blue-white gradient for sRGB varieties. Oklab is perpectually uniform, without a hue shift.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        However, when we use other color spaces like Oklab, even blends from colors inside the sRGB gamut can produce
        out-of-gamut colors. To compensate for this, we will need to use gamut mapping:
      </p>

      <div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <div class="span2"></div>
        <div class="span4 example">
          <div id="sRGBGamutMap-example"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 206px; height: 180px;"></div></div>
          sRGB triangle with (relative colorimetric) gamut mapping

        </div>
        <div class="span2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Additionally, many monitors are now capable of displaying a wider gamut of colors than sRGB. Chrome and Safari
        support the extended colors inside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">Display P3</a> color space.
        As seen, this can be helpful even if most elements are in sRGB, however it can also be impactful to use the
        bolder colors in the extended gamut. Many GPU rasterization solutions do not yet support this.

        Hopefully soon, we will have a convenient interface to show high dynamic range (HDR) content, but Alpenglow will be able
        to support it when it is available.

      <p>
        Most Canvas/SVG implementations do not support upsampling with the Mitchell-Netravali ("cubic") filter, and will
        blend in a gamma-incorrect way. Additionally, we are able to represent images with exact analytic filters, so
        that a box filter upsampling will have nicely anti-aliased edges.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Image downsampling is also prone to both aliasing arifacts and gamma-incorrect blending. Many Canvas implementations
        will quickly sample an image, leading to serious ringing patterns on these example images. There are many cases
        where we will want to use a higher-quality downsampling algorithm, and we can compute an exact analytic filtered
        result.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is recommended to see the <a href="./doc/downscale.png">image</a> at full (1:1) size, to see how the above methods
        scale the image down.

      <h3 id="overview-relatedWork">Related Work</h3>

      <h4>GPU Vector Graphics</h4>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/linebender/vello">Vello</a> is the most similar project, and we've tested integration
        of it <a href="https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/tree/vello">into Scenery</a>. It's the main inspiration for
        this project, and we plan to use many components from it. However, it was tricky getting it to work on the web
        (compiling it for WASM creates a bundle in excess of 5MB), and thus required rewriting the Rust code into TypeScript.
        At the time it didn't have support for avoiding conflation artifacts, and now (as of writing) it is using a more
        expensive multisampling approach to reduce the effects of conflation. Additionally, it runs into gamma blending
        problems, and doesn't support additional color spaces currently. The approach we are using is different enough
        that it unfortunately can't be integrated into Vello.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other libraries that target the GPU for similar rendering include
        <a href="https://github.com/servo/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> (discontinued),
        <a href="https://github.com/google/forma">Forma</a> (not under active development),
        <a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/src/graphics/lib/compute/spinel/">Spinel</a>,
        and <a href="https://github.com/flutter/engine/tree/main/impeller">Flutter's Impeller</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, browsers have some built-in support for GPU-accelerated vector graphics, most notably with
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a> and
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a>. These approaches have decent performance,
        but performance can be improved with the WebGPU/WebGL solutions above. Additionally, they run into the
        conflation/gamma/aliasing artifacts previously described (in order to improve their performance).
      </p>

      <h4>Anti-Aliased Vector Graphics</h4>

      <p>
        For filtering-based analytic rasterization, we've explored other recent approaches, including
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="doi:10.1080/2151237X.2005.10129191"></span>,
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="doi:10.1080/2151237X.2005.10129189"></span>,
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1111:cgf.12070"></span>, which could also be included/implemented.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the general GPU processing, relevant literature is in
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/1409060.1409088"></span>,
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/2018323.2018337"></span>, and
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/2661229.2661274"></span> are particularly promising, as the
        inspiring approaches behind Vello.
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="GPUpathtracingSA16"></span> could also be explored.
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially for text, many approaches look to be patent/license encumbered, most notably the Loop-Blinn approach
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="loop2005resolution"></span> (with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iv-image-effects/chapter-25-rendering-vector-art-gpu">notes</a>).
        The <a href="https://sluglibrary.com/">Slug</a> library seems like the go-to solution for games, backed by
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="Lengyel2017FontRendering"></span>.
        Signed distance fields like in
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/1281500.1281665"></span> and
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="MCDF"></span> lose too much accuracy for our purposes,
        however there are examples of <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sKyzW">exact Cubic beziers</a> with SDFs
        which can <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sySDK">render text</a>. There are also a few approaches using
        circular window approaches:
        <a href="https://wdobbie.com/post/gpu-text-rendering-with-vector-textures/">A</a> and
        <a href="https://gasiulis.name/vector-graphics-on-gpu/">B</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>WebGPU</h4>

      <p>
        High quality libraries for the CUDA interface to GPUs exist, and this work is inspired by
        <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl">Thrust</a> <span class="citation" data-citation-id="BELL2012359"></span>
        and <a href="https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu/wiki">moderngpu</a>
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="Baxter:2016:M2"></span>. They serve as prime examples of useful patterns,
        but can't target WebGPU. In addition, many algorithms rely in forward progress or workgroup communication that
        WebGPU doesn't offer (in an effort for portability), so we will need to explore new approaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are also good shader generation systems, but which don't target WebGPU. Notably
        <a href="https://github.com/shader-slang/slang">Slang</a>
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/3197517.3201380"></span>
        <span class="citation" data-citation-id="bangaru2023slangd"></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://usegpu.live/">Use.GPU</a> takes a novel approach with WebGPU, but focuses on rendering instead of
        the compute primitives.

      <h3 id="overview-contributions">Contributions</h3>

      <p>
        Current contributions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          New approach to solving 2D occlusion/overlapping with computational geometry at the start of the rasterization
          process. Based on our previous work for PhET's <a href="https://github.com/phetsims/kite">computational geometry library</a>,
          we are able to compute the overlap for many general regions at the same time (but using line segments with
          rational values for exact intersections and robustness).
        </li>
        <li>
          New approach to anti-aliasing with filters (evaluating arbitrary polynomial integrals over polygons, based on
          Green's Theorem). It's efficient (allows bilinear filtering with minimal performance burden), and compatible
          with other future segment types (quadratic/cubic Bezier curves, elliptical arcs, etc.).
          This also allows <a href="#antialiasing-examples">computing exact blurs</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          New approach to <a href="#depthSort">3D graphics (using the above)</a>, where we compute (exact vector)
          occlusion and some perspective-corrected exact integrals (for barycentric-based coordinates on triangular meshes).
        </li>
        <li>
          New approach to recursive clipping of polygons, particularly with the ability to handle degenerate cases
          in a compact fashion on a GPU.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initial work for generating WGSL for high-performance computational primitives in generic form (reduce,
          prefix sum, radix sort, merge sort, stream compaction, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          New approach to <a href="#asyncSimulation">simulating the WebGPU execution model</a> with TypeScript async/await
          patterns (for evaluation of race conditions, uniformity, indeterminate behavior, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Planned contributions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          High-performance WebGPU implementation of the Alpenglow strategy, including the preceding stages (for
          transformation, conversion to line segments, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Library for generic parallel computation primitives (using code generation/templating with WGSL, or potentially
          extending WGSL to a new language with templating support).
        </li>
        <li>
          Full integration of Alpenglow WebGPU into <a href="https://github.com/phetsims/scenery">Scenery</a> (as a renderer) and
          PhET simulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further exploration of 3D rasterization using this approach, including general (exact!) perspective-corrected
          integrals across triangles when displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Canvas API replacement that supports a fully vector-based description of the current Canvas state (same
          drawing commands, but can be resized/queried and has an underling vector representation). Should be able to do
          this in a high-performance way where we will have the quality of Alpenglow. Drawing over parts of the Canvas
          will "merge" vector regions into one where appropriate, so we can have a finite-memory representation of the
          state after an arbitrary number of drawing commands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Static SVG to Alpenglow converter, which will transform SVG files into Alpenglow render programs for display.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extension of the Alpenglow approach to additional curve types (hopefully in a robust way). Intersections for
          quadratic/cubic Bezier curves and elliptical arcs present some robustness problems. I would like to investigate
          rationally-based curves with rational sections (looking into
          <span class="citation" data-citation-id="Wildberger2005"></span>) to see if we can extend the robust approach.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="overview-impact">Desired Impact</h3>

      <p>
        Ideally, Alpenglow would be able to replace the usage of Canvas/SVG (and some WebGL) for the purpose of displaying
        interactive graphics and UI, both in <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET Interactive Simulations</a> and in other projects.
        Canvas API integration could be a drop-in replacement for existing Canvas usage, with higher-quality output.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, since the target is to rely on WebGPU, it would be possible to run the same code in native applications
        (using <a href="https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn">Dawn</a> or <a href="https://wgpu.rs/">WGPU</a>),
        or possibly at the OS level. This could be potentially useful for rendering native UIs, or anything that needs
        scale-independent high-quality graphics.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would also allow <a href="https://github.com/phetsims/scenery">Scenery</a> to be a higher-performance solution
        for interactive graphics and user interfaces on the web, especially in an accessibility-compatible way.
      </p>

      <h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

      <h3 id="polygonalFaces">Polygonal Faces</h3>

      <p>
        Polygonal faces are used pervasively throughout Alpenglow. In general, our data structures are designed to support
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_with_holes">polygons with holes</a>, and more generally, the
        primitive is a "list of polygons". An example is the following diagram, which can be stored in different ways:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="polygonal-face-example"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        All of the storage representations below conform to the <code>ClippableFace</code> interface in the software
        implementation.
      </p>

      <h4>Polygonal Form</h4>

      <p>
        It can be represented in the polygonal form as three (directed) lists of vertices (with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule">nonzero winding rule</a>):
      </p>

      <p>
        (0,&nbsp;0),
        (10,&nbsp;0),
        (10,&nbsp;2),
        (2,&nbsp;10),
        (0,&nbsp;10)
        <br>
        (2,&nbsp;2),
        (2,&nbsp;7),
        (7,&nbsp;2)
        <br>
        (9,&nbsp;9),
        (6,&nbsp;9),
        (9,&nbsp;6)
      </p>

      <p>
        where there is a line (edge) between each consecutive pair of vertices, and the last vertex is connected to the
        first vertex. This is compact, however the order is critical. This can cause certain operations (e.g. circular
        clipping, some tracing) to be slower than other methods. This is handled by <code>PolygonalFace</code> in the
        software implementation.
      </p>

      <h4>Edge Form</h4>

      <p>
        For much of Alpenglow's needs, things work better if we consider the list of edges itself (with start/end vertices):
      </p>

      <p>
        (0,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(10,&nbsp;0),
        (10,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(10,&nbsp;2),
        (10,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;10),
        (2,&nbsp;10)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;10),
        (0,&nbsp;10)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;0)

        (2,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;7),
        (2,&nbsp;7)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(7,&nbsp;2),
        (7,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;2)

        (9,&nbsp;9)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(6,&nbsp;9),
        (6,&nbsp;9)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(9,&nbsp;6),
        (9,&nbsp;6)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(9,&nbsp;9)
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, for most critical operations, order doesn't matter, and each edge can be considered in isolation.
        We won't need to sort things during/after operations, but also certain operations might need to generate more
        edges that get canceled out (whereas with polygonal data, we could detect it and simplify in higher-performance
        ways). This form is handled by <code>EdgedFace</code> in the software implementation.
      </p>

      <h4>Degenerate Edges</h4>

      <p>
        Additionally, we can actually construct this with an equivalent single (degenerate) polygon. Since we only care
        about the filled area, it turns out that edges that "reverse" over each other won't contribute to the filled area,
        so we can double-back. Thus the following diagram:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="polygonal-face-canceling"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        can be constructed with an equivalent area with the following polygon:
      </p>

      <p>
        (0,&nbsp;0),
        (10,&nbsp;0),
        (10,&nbsp;2),
        (7,&nbsp;2),
        (2,&nbsp;2),
        (2,&nbsp;7),
        (6,&nbsp;9),
        (9,&nbsp;6),
        (9,&nbsp;9),
        (6,&nbsp;9),
        (2,&nbsp;7),
        (7,&nbsp;2),
        (10,&nbsp;2),
        (2,&nbsp;10),
        (0,&nbsp;10)
      </p>

      <h4>Edge-Clipped Form</h4>

      <p>
        It turns out, for computational complexity of future clipping operations (see below), it is very helpful to NOT
        directly store the edges that go along the full edge of the clipping rectangle (e.g. the 0,0 to 10,10 region in
        the diagram). Instead, those edges will be counted. Due to the property above of degenerate edges, these counts
        can be added together to add the contribution of these "clipped" edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The diagram below shows the edge orientations that get positive (+1) counts. Reversed edges will get negative (-1)
        counts:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="polygonal-face-edge-clips"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Thus the edge-clipped version (for the 0,0 to 10,10 bounds) will have the following edges and counts:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="polygonal-face-edge-clipped"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        (10,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(10,&nbsp;2),
        (10,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;10),
        (2,&nbsp;10)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;10),

        (2,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;7),
        (2,&nbsp;7)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(7,&nbsp;2),
        (7,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;2)

        (9,&nbsp;9)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(6,&nbsp;9),
        (6,&nbsp;9)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(9,&nbsp;6),
        (9,&nbsp;6)&nbsp;=>&nbsp;(9,&nbsp;9)
      </p>

      <p>
        This is handled by the <code>EdgedClippedFace</code> in the software implementation.

        Create "Bounds Pyramid" immutable data structure. It's a binary tree, leaves are edges. Each level stores the
        bounding box. PIP-tests are VERY accelerated on this. Clipping also potentially will be (if a node is fully within
        one side of a binary clip, we can just INCLUDE that node). Thus we will have a linked list way of describing how
        the nodes connect (so we can reuse parts of the source within the result). At a certain point, this will be less
        beneficial, but high-up it might be very helpful? Test PIP and clipping with this. (each section has bounds and

      <p>
        This will delve into some of the mathematics and background information behind the anti-aliasing techniques used
        in Alpenglow. Most of the anti-aliasing is based on being able to clip polygons down to pixel boundaries, and then
        integrating the polygonal coverage over the pixel.
      </p>

      <h5>Green's Theorem and Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem">Green's Theorem</a>, we can convert a double
        integral over a region into a line integral over the (closed, oriented counter-clockwise) boundary of the region:
      </p>

      <p>
        $$
        \oint_P\left(L\,\frac{dx}{dt}+M\,\frac{dy}{dt}\right)dt=\iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy
        $$
      </p>

      <p>
        for curves parameterized on $t$.
      </p>

      <p>
        For polygons, this means that if we can evaluate a line integral over each line segment (between $(x_i,y_i)$ and
        $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$, finishing with $(x_i,y_i)$ to $(x_0,y_0)$), we can sum up each edge's contribution to
        evaluate the double integral for the region inside the polygon. Each line segment is parameterized curve:
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>
        $$
        x=x(t)=(1-t)x_i+(t)x_{i+1}=x_i+t(x_{i+1}-x_i)
        $$

        $$
        y=y(t)=(1-t)y_i+(t)y_{i+1}=y_i+t(y_{i+1}-y_i)
        $$

        for $0 \le t \le 1$, with the derivatives:

        $$
        \frac{dx}{dt}=x_{i+1}-x_i
        $$

        $$
        \frac{dy}{dt}=y_{i+1}-y_i
        $$

        Note:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If we reverse an edge (swap its endpoints), it will swap the sign of the contribution to the integral (a polygon
          can make a degenerate turn and double-back precisely, with no contribution to area). Thus for terms, swapping $i$
          and $i+1$ will swap the sign of the contribution. This means that polygons with holes can be evaluated by
          visiting the holes with the opposite orientation (clockwise).
        </li>
        <li>
          This is evaluated on closed polygons, so any terms that only depend on one endpoint will cancel out (e.g.
          $x_i^2y_i$ and $-x_{i+1}^2y_{i+1}$ will have their contributions cancel out, since both of those will be
          evaluated for every point in the polygon). It is useful to adjust the coefficients to these terms, since they
          can allow us to factor the expressions into simpler forms (e.g. the Shoelace formula below).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We can pick $L$ and $M$ below:

        $$
        L=(n-1)\int f\,dy
        $$

        $$
        M=(n)\int f\,dx
        $$

        so that

        $$
        \iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy=
        \iint_P \left( (n)f - (n-1)f \right)\,dx\,dy=
        \iint_P f\,dx\,dy
        $$

        for any antiderivatives and real $n$, since the double integral will then be integrating our function $f$. It turns
        out, evaluating Green's Theorem over line segments for polynomial terms for any linear blend (any $n$) of $L$ and
        $M$ will differ only in the "canceled out" terms, so each edge's contribution will be the same.
      </p>

      <h5>Integrating Arbitrary Polynomials over Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        If we zero out all of the canceled terms, it turns out that we can evaluate the integral of any polynomial term $x^my^n$ over a polygon $P$ by summing up the contributions of each edge:

        $$
        \iint_Px^my^n\,dx\,dy=\frac{m!n!}{(m+n+2)!}\sum_{i}\left[ (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i) \sum_{p=0}^m\sum_{q=0}^n \binom{p+q}{q}\binom{m+n-p-q}{n-q}x_i^{m-p}x_{i+1}^py_i^{n-q}y_{i+1}^q \right]
        $$

        This was first discovered by <span class="citation" data-citation-id="Soerjadi1968OnTC"></span>.
        The contributions of each term can be summed up individually to integrate arbitrary polynomials.
      </p>

      <p>
        e.g. for $x^4y^2$ in matrix form:

        $$
        \iint_Px^4y^2\,dx\,dy=
        \frac{1}{840}
        \sum_{i}
        \left(
        (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x_i^4 & x_i^3x_{i+1} & x_i^2x_{i+1}^2 & x_ix_{i+1}^3 & x_{i+1}^4
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        15 & 5 & 1\\
        10 & 8 & 3\\
        6 & 9 & 6\\
        3 & 8 & 10\\
        1 & 5 & 15
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        y_i^2\\
        y_iy_{i+1}\\
        y_{i+1}^2
        \end{bmatrix}
        \right)
        $$
      </p>

      <h5>Area of Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        For $x^0y^0=1$, with adding some canceling terms to better factor, we will obtain the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">Shoelace formula</a> for finding the area of a polygon:

        $$
        area_P=\iint_P1\,dx\,dy=
        \frac{1}{2}
        \sum_{i}
        (x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)
        $$
      </p>

      <h5>Centroids of Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        <strong>NOTE: see numerical stability notes below, this top way can be inaccurate with floating-point numbers</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        For $x$ and $y$, we have:

        $$
        \iint_Px\,dx\,dy=
        \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(x_i+x_{i+1})
        $$

        $$
        \iint_Py\,dx\,dy=
        \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(y_i+y_{i+1})
        $$

        We can divide the integrals of $x$ and $y$ by the area to get the centroid of the polygon:

        $$
        centroid_x=
        \frac{1}{3}
        \frac{\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(x_i+x_{i+1})}{\sum_{i}(x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)}
        $$

        $$
        centroid_y=
        \frac{1}{3}
        \frac{\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(y_i+y_{i+1})}{\sum_{i}(x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)}
        $$

        This is particularly useful, since if we have any linear function over $(x,y)$ (say, a linear gradient between
        two colors), the average color in the polygon would be the value of that function at the centroid!
      </p>

      <h5>Numerical Stability (addendum)</h5>

      <p>
        The above formulas (from <span class="citation" data-citation-id="DrangGreens"></span>)
        seem to magnify floating-point error significantly. It's highly recommended that either of the following methods
        be used for computation:
      </p>

      <p>
        For the highest precision (but for which there is not as much shared computation between the $x$ and $y$ formulas),
        we can use the following:

        $$
        \iint_Px\,dx\,dy
        =\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i}(x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2) (y_{i+1} - y_i)
        $$

        $$
        \iint_Py\,dx\,dy
        =\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i}(y_i^2 + y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2) (x_i - x_{i+1})
        $$

        For higher performance (but with about 30% more numerical error), one with more shared computation can be used:

        $$
        \iint_Px\,dx\,dy
        =\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i}(x_i-x_{i+1})(x_i(2y_i+y_{i+1}) + x_{i+1}(y_i+2y_{i_1}))
        $$

        $$
        \iint_Py\,dx\,dy
        =\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i}(y_{i+1}-y_i)(x_i(2y_i+y_{i+1}) + x_{i+1}(y_i+2y_{i_1}))
        $$

        Both of these approaches are incredibly more stable than the first formula pair (about half a million times less
        error, with triangles centered in x,y in (0,1000), with sizes around 1/1000).

      </p>

      <p>
        For example, with p0={x: 716.1014074033982, y: 879.8148178803798}, p1={x: 716.1017435139888, y: 879.8150887077004},
        p2={x: 716.1021422611582, y: 879.8154096593055}. The top method gives {x: 238.700559480381, y: 293.2716129164566}
        (! distance of more than 700 from the real centroid), whereas the error (distance) for the other methods are
        less than 1e-3

      </p>

      <h5>Evaluation of Filtered Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        Any polynomial-based (windowed or not) filter can be evaluated over a polygon with this approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple practical example is the tent filter (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">Bilinear filtering</a>).
        It is effectively evaluating the integral $(1-x)(1-y)=xy-x-y+1$ over $0\le x\le1,0\le y\le1$, which we can now
        evaluate as:

        $$
        \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(12-4( x_i+y_i+x_{i+1}+y_{i+1})+2(x_iy_i+x_{i+1}y_{i+1})+
        x_iy_{i+1}+x_{i+1}y_i)
        $$
      </p>

      <h5>Evaluation of Distance over Polygons</h5>

      <p>
        Above, we saw the centroid is useful to compute exact linear gradient contributions. For purely-circular radial gradients, the equivalent is also possible to compute! We will need to instead integrate $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ (we can determine the average by dividing by the area).
      </p>

      <p>
        We will need to transform to polar coordinates first:

        $$
        r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
        $$

        $$
        \theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}
        $$

        We will want to evaluate with Green's Theorem in polar coordinates:

        $$
        \oint_P\left(L\,\frac{dr}{dt}+M\,\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)dt=\iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial r}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \right)\,dA
        $$

        but we will want to evaluate $r^2$ due to the coordinate change.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we pick $M=\frac{1}{3}r^3$ and $L=0$, the double integral will be our desired integral (note, $M=\frac{1}{2}r^2$ gives us the same Shoelace-like area formula).
      </p>

      <p>
        Given our definitions of $x=x_i+t(x_{i+1}-x_i)$ and $y=y_i+t(y_{i+1}-y_i)$:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{d\theta}{dt}&=\frac{d}{dt}\tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x} \\
        &=\frac{d}{dt}\tan^{-1}\frac{y_i+t(y_{i+1}-y_i)}{x_i+t(x_{i+1}-x_i)} \\
        &=\frac{x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i}{t^2((x_{i_1}-x_i)^2+(y_{i+1}-y_i)^2)-2t(x_i^2-x_ix_{i+1}-y_iy_{i+1}+y_i^2)+(x_i^2+y_i^2)}
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        Thus given $M$ and $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$, we can evaluate (with Mathematica in this case):

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \oint_P\left(M\,\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)dt&=\int_0^1\frac{1}{3}r^3\frac{d\theta}{dt}\,dt \\

      <h5>Checking if a Polygon is not Closed</h5>

      <p>
        We can integrate $0$ over a polygon's edges in a similar way, to compute if the polygon is not closed (there are some cases where this happens and is useful).

        $$
        0=\sum_{i}(x_iy_i-x_{i+1}y_{i+1})
        $$

        This test (and any other tests of this type) will have false-negatives (for instance, if all the points are on an x or y axis, this formula won't detect non-closed polygons). However the useful probability of that happening can be reduced by using a random point as a translation:

        $$
        0=\sum_{i}\left[(x_i-p_x)(y_i-p_y)-(x_{i+1}-p_x)(y_{i+1}-p_y)\right]
        $$

      <h5>Alpenglow Area Formulas</h5>

      <p>
        We are best served by the Shoelace formula. It is fast and has good numerical performance:
      </p>

      <p>
        $$
        area=
        \frac{1}{2}
        \sum_{i}
        (x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)
        $$

        For our edge-clipped polygons, we will want to add in the contribution of the counts:

        $$
        area_{clip} = ( y_{max} - y_{min} )( count_{x_{min}} x_{min} + count_{x_{max}} x_{max} )
        $$

        NOTE that it only uses two of the counts! We can't abuse this too much, because for recursive clipping we still
        need to store the opposite counts.
      </p>

      <h5>Alpenglow Centroid Formulas</h5>

      <p>
        As noted above, some of the more common formulas have terrible numerical performance. We are using the following
        one, since it results in simple formulas for the normal and edge-clipped cases, AND it shares a good amount of
        the computation between the $x$ and $y$ formulas:
      </p>

      <p>
        $$
        centroid =
        \frac{1}{6\ area}
        \sum_{i}
        \left( x_i ( 2 y_i + y_{i+1} ) + x_{i+1} ( y_i + 2 y_{i+1} ) \right)
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x_i - x_{i+1} \\ y_{i+1} - y_i
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        Additionally for our edge-clipped polygons, we will want to add the contribution based on the counts:

        $$
        centroid_{clip} =
        \frac{1}{area}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{avg} ( x_{min} - x_{max} ) * ( count_{y_{min}} * y_{min} + count_{y_{max}} * y_{max} ) \\
        y_{avg} ( y_{max} - y_{min} ) * ( count_{x_{min}} * x_{min} + count_{x_{max}} * x_{max} )
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        Where $x_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}(x_{min}+x_{max})$ and $y_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}(y_{min}+y_{max})$ are the values of the
        center of the edge-clipped area.

      </p>

      <p>
        For each filter, we are going to evaluate it at a pixel's "center" to get a single sample. We will do this by
        evaluating the integral of the filter's value over the area included in the polygon within the filter's range of
        support.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below, we are able to evaluate piecewise-polynomial filters with an exact analytical solution. While the box filter
        has one piecewise-polynomial section (the constant function), the others are split up into gridded sections,
        each of which is a polynomial. We will essentially determine the clipped part of the polygon for each section,
        and evaluate the integral with the formula for that section.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOTE: When using a non-box filter, we will need to examine/process a larger area than just the resulting bounds.
        In the code, this is called the <code>contributionBounds</code>.
      </p>

      <h5>Box Filter</h5>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="box-diagram"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 600px; height: 200px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We will take our filter (which is a constant function of 1 in a unit-square centered on the origin), and evaluate
        it just for the square area around it. This is equivalent to finding the area of the polygon within this square area.
      </p>

      <h5>Bilinear Filter</h5>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="bilinear-diagram"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 600px; height: 200px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Bilinear filtering uses the tent filter $f(t) = |1-t|$ for $t \in [-1,1]$, but extended to 2D:
        $f(x,y) = |1-x| |1-y|$. Thus it has four quadrants, each of which is polynomial. We can evaluate the integral for
        the edges of the clipped polygon within each of these quadrants with the formula:

        $$
        \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(12-4( x_i+y_i+x_{i+1}+y_{i+1})+2(x_iy_i+x_{i+1}y_{i+1})+
        x_iy_{i+1}+x_{i+1}y_i)
        $$

        We can simply take the absolute value of the relative $x$ and $y$ values, and use the same formula for all
        quadrants.
      </p>

      <h5>Mitchell-Netravali Filter</h5>

      <div class="example">
        <div id="mitchell-netravali-diagram"><div class="example placeholder" style="width: 600px; height: 200px;"></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Mitchell-Netravali filter (really a class of filters, where we use the common parameter values $B=1/3$ and $C=1/3$)
        is a piecewise-polynomial filter. Notably:

        $$
        f(t)=
        \begin{cases}
          |t|<1, & \frac{1}{6}((12 - 9B - 6C)t^3 + (-18 + 12B + 6C)t^2 + (6 - 2B)) \\
          1\le |t| < 2, & \frac{1}{6}((-B - 6C)t^3 + (6B + 30C)t^2 + (-12B - 48C) t + (8B + 24C))
        \end{cases}

        $$

        We will use the above polynomial filtering techniques to evaluate the integral. The resulting formulas are not
        terribly pretty. We will have 3 cases to handle after symmetry (we can use the absolute value to get down to 4
        cases, and then reflection to get down to 3).
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that this filter also has sections where it goes negative, so it can actually cause negative values.
        We try not to clamp color values until the very end (during gamut mapping), so that this effect will work nicely.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will result in 16 different sections, each of which will contribute to a final output sample (pixel).
      </p>

      <h4 id="antialiasing-examples">Examples</h4>

      <p>
        Aliasing (what we are trying to avoid) is the low-frequency pattern that spuriously appears when we display
        high-frequency content in a low-resolution way. In general, we want to reduce these low-frequency patterns
        without overly introducing blurring.

      <p>
        Blending of colors is important to get right for correct visual results. There are multiple color spaces where
        blending can be done. Furthermore, anti-aliasing with correct blending will give a more accurate appearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in the above anti-aliasing examples, on many browsers the SVG/Canvas examples will show a "darkening"
        in areas where there is a lot of overlap. This is typically a result of blending in the sRGB color space, which
        is NOT linear.

        NOTE: That the CAG process is essentially just simplifying into a different RenderStack (RenderUnion, because it

        us a RenderableFace broken down to the pixel level. Note that we split everything except for gradients/depth at the
        first step, THEN we split gradients/depth. We could potentially generalize to different stages of splitting, OR
        we could force splitting all at once.

      <h4 id="RenderColor">RenderColor</h4>

      <p>
        RenderColor displays a single solid color everywhere, and is a basic building-block for many other RenderPrograms.

      <p>
        Note that the default color space is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>. Additionally, the
        values are by default interpreted with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing#Straight_versus_premultiplied">premultiplied alpha</a>
        (also called associated alpha), so <code>0.5, 0, 0, 0.5</code> will represent a 50% transparent fully-red color.
      </p>

      <h4 id="RenderPathBoolean">RenderPathBoolean</h4>

      <p>
        RenderPathBoolean will display one RenderProgram "inside" the path, and another RenderProgram "outside" the path.

        RenderLinearBlend will interpolate between two different RenderPrograms based on the location. It will evaluate
        <code>clamp( dot( scaledNormal, point ) - offset, 0, 1 )</code>, and will linearly blend between the "zero"
        program (when the value is 0) and the "one" program (when the value is 1).

      <h4 id="renderProgram-simplification">Simplification</h4>

      <p class="TODO">Documentation</p>

      <h4 id="renderProgram-execution">Execution</h4>

      <p>
        The software tree form of RenderPrograms can be directly executed. However it is better if we turn our RenderProgram
        into a series of instructions that can be executed in a more efficient way.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are able to output instructions (both in software as types, and on the GPU in a binary format) that operate in
        a simple stack-based fashion. We will have a main stack, where vec4 values are pushed and popped. Instructions
        primarily either push content, or pop content then push more content (processing existing values). We are able to
        determine a bound on the stack size by analyzing the RenderProgram (normal visual blending won't cause stack
        issues, since we are able to blend each pair of colors before computing the next color).
      </p>

      <p>
        This is combined with a stack of instruction indices, to support function calls and return values, in addition to
        simple branching logic. It turns out all of the primitives we need can be done with "opaque jumps" (if the top of
        the stack is a fully-opaque value, jump to an instruction index) and function calls.
      </p>

      <h5>Inputs for Evaluation</h5>

      <p>
        <code>RenderEvaluationContext</code> represents the main inputs to evaluation, namely:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bounding box of affected area (typically clipped to pixel sizes)</li>
        <li>(optional) face data (<code>ClippableFace</code>, or other edge-clipped data on the GPU)</li>
        <li>(optional) area</li>
        <li>(optional) centroid</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Direct Evaluation</h5>

      <p>
        <code>RenderProgram</code> (TS object) supports the direct evaluation by calling
        <code>.evaluate( context: RenderEvaluationContext )</code>.
      </p>

      <h5>Instruction Evaluation</h5>

      <p>
        <code>RenderProgram</code> has a method <code>.writeInstructions( instructions: RenderInstruction[] )</code> that
        will write out instruction objects (<code>RenderInstruction</code>) in a stream-like fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        These can be evaluated with <code>RenderExecutor</code> in software (load the instructions, and then it can be
        executed many times with different contexts).
      </p>

      <h5>Binary Instruction Evaluation</h5>

      <p>
        <code>RenderInstruction</code> has a number of utilities, including the ability to convert a stream of
        instructions into a binary format. These can then be executed on the GPU with WGSL code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instruction lists in the binary format are always suffixed with an exit instruction, so that we can have a
        solid block containing multiple instruction lists. During rasterization, we need to track the index of the start
        of a RenderProgram's instructions inside this list.
      </p>

      <h5>Instructions Demo</h5>

      <p>
        Edit the below code to see its form, and the object/binary instructions associated with it.

        each light), BUT we really want to minimize the memory individual invocations/threads take up during execution.

        mapping of that), and should handle permutation.

        It will support the "sort by key", etc.

        Current weakness with a pipeline that would be given different inputs (e.g. ping-ponging in radix sort).
        Current slot approach will require multiple pipelines (... more of a compilation step?) that will be
        long-term undesirable. However it sounds tricky to actually have different inputs on a pipeline (as that might
        actually constrain our bind group layout setup), since we'd need to pick ONE bind group layout for the pipeline.

        To repair... what if we had "switchable" buffer slots?

        Flows: we can actually just construct multiple different "routines" (e.g. reduce), and pick the one based on
        the constraint. How can we provide notes about the possible configurations to the bind group layout strategy?
        Really need to nail down bind group layout examples. What if flows are branching (e.g. any node can have multiple

        IMPORTANT: We can potentially have different bind groups provided for different flow cases. Even if they are

      <h4 id="WGSL-recording">Recording</h4>

      <p class="TODO">
<br>        Plan is to record all WebGPU commands.
<br>
<br>        Goals:
<br>        (a) Replay for performance tests (run 1x or 100x a frame, be able to setup and destroy).
<br>            Have setup, run, and dispose.
<br>        (b) JS output suitable for manual iteration to test performance tweaks rapidly.
<br>        (c) Reproduction of bugs (particularly platform-specific ones), with easily readable WGSL/WebGPU commands.
<br>        (d) Record system details required for correct playback (e.g. the texture format we can use), conditionally
<br>            run the "compatible" tests.
<br>        (e) Historical record of performance
<br>        (f) Compatibility so that others could use the same format (for performance tests).
<br>
<br>        A command will record its input/output (what named objects it uses, and what it produces).
<br>        A closure is a group of commands, which will have its unbound resources (and a list of what it declares).
<br>        We will select sections of these, and be able to build repeatable performance tests
<br>        (record setup, in-frame, and cleanup respectively).
<br>
<br>        Closure will note the "raw JSON" of parameters, MINUS the named objects. It will list the replacement paths
<br>        into the JSON object (where the named objects are placed).
<br>          ACTUALLY: Just record the actual object. When we "to-string" it, we'll provide a mapping of object => name,
<br>          AND we will have to actually handle the proper types of descriptors anyway (e.g. to handle enumerations).
<br>          It will be "good" to record the dependencies (actual objects) and the result (actual object).
<br>
<br>        --- HOW to record "when map async / submitted work done" based things? Presumably for performance tests, we
<br>        don't need this. -- we COULD record the initial order the promises are resolved with, and then replay those?
<br>
<br>        TODO: record onSubmittedWorkDone()
<br>
<br>        Renumber/label objects when we generate JS (so... don't label them before, just reference them?).
<br>        If there aren't multiple, do NOT apply a number (e.g. device). Consider generating variable name prefixes
<br>        FROM labels?
<br>
<br>        ArrayBuffers: Do we store persistent and non-changing ones as "one object"? We could just recreate an ArrayBuffer
<br>        for every data transfer. We could also see the length and contents, and store it as a "constant" on the new end.
<br>
<br>        Wrap Canvas calls (if "discovered", record the resolution). Wrap the configure and texture getter.
<br>
<br>        Record with a list of command lists (new commands will go into all of them), so we can add/remove lists of
<br>        commands to record into (that might be nested).
<br>
<br>        Output JS for quick iteration. Map flag/enumeration values to their "good" forms.
<br>        - Be able to output JS closures, and performance test units (based on what is missing).
<br>        - Remember to record "destroy" and cleanup for performance tests.
<br>        - only line-breaks in options objects, not based on parameters
<br>
<br>        Output serialization (or use in-memory) for actual re-execution (re-bind or use references, could use for production?)
<br>
<br>        Should allow for starting/stopping recording (and for sections), so we can record multiple different things.
<br>        Can choose to avoid device creation (bind device), and can only record inner-command-encoder parts (bind
<br>        command encoder).
<br>
<br>        When we run into "unknown" objects, handle it safely. Use instanceof to determine what type of object, then
<br>        give it a name/entry. It will be in the closure.
<br>
<br>        Buffer logger support (for debugging reproduction cases) - console.log anything that we've successfully
<br>        mapAsync'ed?
<br>
<br>        NOTE: Having all of the old raster clipper recorded could be interesting!

        Commutative and non-commutative monoids have to be handled differently. For commutative cases, we can load it

      <h3 id="asyncSimulation">Async Simulation</h3>

      <p>
        For use in rapid prototyping and debugging WGSL-like structured code, we've created the ability to run code with
        a similar execution model to WGSL with async/await code in JS/TS.
      </p>

      <p>
        It uses async/await to simulate the execution model by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Running threads/invocations and workgroups in parallel, by awaiting every storage/workgroup read/write (or
          synchronization barrier).
        </li>
        <li>
          Blocking all progress on threads in a workgroup on a synchronization barrier until all threads have reached it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recording all of the read/writes to storage/workgroup arrays (and which thread/workgroup they were set by),
          with logic on synchronization barriers. This allows detecting potential data races, uniformity issues,
          missing barriers, or other issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Returning indeterminate values from out-of-bounds or un-initialized array accesses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the model, typically <code>ParallelStorageArray</code>s are created, and then shaders are dispatched
        by running <code>ParallelExecutor</code>'s <code>dispatch()</code> method (with the dispatch size passed in).
        <code>ParallelExecutor</code>s are created with <code>ParallelKernel</code>, which is roughly equivalent to
        individual shaders. They will specify an async execute function, in addition to a way of creating workgroup-scoped
        values (in a statically-typed way). Workgroup-scoped values can be either atomics, or <code>ParallelWorkgroupArray</code>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        The execute function is given a reference to a context (<code>ParallelContext</code>) that will provide access to
        workgroup-scoped values and synchronization barriers (workgroupBarrier/storageBarrier) directly.
        It's also passed to storage/workgroup data read/writes, so that we can record the accesses and fail out assertions
        if certain data access pattersn are detected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>ParallelRaster</code> is an example of TypeScript code validating the model used for the raster-clipping
        process. <code>ParallelRasterSplitScan</code> is an example of a single shader in this model.
      </p>

      <h3 id="depthSort">Depth Sort</h3>

      <p>
        If we store data about what 3D plane each face is on (essentially assigning a depth to each 2d point), it is
        possible to analytically determine the exact divisions between sections where one face is in front of the other.
        For any given pair of planes, there is a 2d line in screen space that delineates the boundary between the two
        areas (the "depth sort line"). We will use this to further split our polygons into disjoint sections where we have
        a total ordering of the planar faces (recall, Alpenglow stages will already have found us a section that is fully
        contained within the faces).
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be used to render 3d scenes, using sorting/splitting of the faces (instead of the normal technique of
        using a depth buffer). We will have a fully vector-friendly description of the 3d scene, down to an arbitrary
        precision!

      <h3 id="stage-transforms">Transforms</h3>

      <p>
        Use a stack monoid setup to compute the nested transforms for every path. This is not particularly required from
        Scenery (we CAN compute them CPU-side, but it uses up a lot of CPU time). However, we can ship over paths in an
        instanced fashion (e.g. font glyphs), and this stage would convert from the DAG to effectively a flat array of
        paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOTE: This will include perspective projection for 3D?
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-subdivision">Subdivision</h3>

      <p>
        We will want to convert our paths to polygons (a piecewise linear form). This could come before or after the
        transform step. Might need more code to do it after the transforms (logic needed to transform elliptical arcs,
        etc., but it would be more efficient.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-bounds">Bounds</h3>

      <p>
        We will want the bounds of each path for later stages.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-tiling">Tiling</h3>

      <p>
        We will subdivide the rendered area into tiles, and for each path we will either skip it, fully include it, or clip it
        to the size of the tile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain potential final rasterization steps benefit from a guaranteed maximum tile size of path (e.g. if we are
        256x256, it would take 16 steps of binary subdivision to reach the pixel level).
      </p>

      <p>
        Tiling is also helpful to reduce the potential amount of cases for the later intersection step, AND with our
        integer transform, we will be able to keep more precision for the CAG steps.
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Note possibility: Just use tiling constraints in intersections and face holes. OTHERWISE we should be able to use
        the heterogeneous combination of tiles for other steps - but we might want to tile for rasterization too.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-integerTransform">Integer Transform</h3>

      <p class="TODO">
        Can we cut precision here further to get better edge sorting? Radix sort on the rationals might be expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will scale up and transform our coordinate frame (for each tile) to integer coordinates, spaced out so that we are
        keeping about 20 bits of information for each coordinate. This will allow us to use rational numbers to compute
        the intersections between line segments (and to sort edges around each vertex) in an exact robust way, keeping our
        numerator and denominator within 64 bits each. Since the outputs will be signed, we will want to put the origin
        approximately in the center of our "integer" coordinate frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our data will be in the <code>IntegerEdge</code> format, which essentially just stores the start point, end point,
        and the path ID.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-hilbertSort">Hilbert Sort</h3>

      <p>
        We will sort the the edges using a higher-dimensional
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert space-filling curve</a>, so that edges are somewhat
        spatially coherent (edges in a similar part of the list will likely have similar positions or sizes). This helps
        reduce the workload on the next step (intersection), since it would have theoretical O(n^2) performance.
        In practice, by having typical visual data AND sorting, we get a small fraction of that!
      </p>

      <p>
        This may be unnecessary for some workloads (where the edges provided are in a spatially coherent order due to
        the scene graph), however it is absolutely necessary for others (e.g. 3d meshes).
      </p>

      <p>
        This is inspired by the bulk loading of R-Trees (see <span class="citation" data-citation-id="10.1145/1963190.2025380"></span>),
        using Hilbert Curve concepts noted in <span class="citation" data-citation-id="Bader2013"></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Planned to use a radix sort on GPU. Software is currently using a 6-dimensional Hilbert sort
        (centerX, centerY, minX, minY, maxX, maxY), but it is probably best to reduce that to a 4-dimensional sort.
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Review paper for more insights. Potentially store Hilbert partials during the sort, OR just compute them to a given
        depth and store the result? (If we get something small however with a ton of dispersed edges... could CRATER
        performance).
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-intersection">Intersection</h3>

      <p>
        We will need to find all of the pairwise intersections between edges. In software, this is done by computing a
        binary tree of bounding boxes (where the Hilbert sort helps significantly). We can ignore the intersection between
        two subtrees whose bounding boxes do not intersect. Furthermore, if there are no horizontal lines in either
        subtree, we can allow the bounding boxes to "touch" horizontally (sharing a single line of intersection) without
        having any substantive pairwise intersection in edges, since we only care about internal intersections (those
        which aren't endpoint-to-endpoint).
      </p>

      <p>
        We will store the intersections with their rational coordinates AND parametric value of intersection (also an
        exact rational) for each internal intersection within each of the edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        This intersection will also detect overlapping segments, and will find the endpoints that are internal to the
        other edge. Thus overlapping edges will thus be fully overlapping, and can be detected by future steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Potentially plan to use bump allocation on the GPU, with a linked list for each edge (with atomic operations).
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-split">Split</h3>

      <p>
        Each integer edge will have a list of internal intersections. We will sort those intersections by their parametric
        value, and then we will output a list of "rational" edges (using `RationalHalfEdge`) that make up each
        non-intersected interval of the original edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will store the winding information for each path in this information. So if our edge in path X goes from A to B,
        we will create two half-edges: A -> B (winding +1) and B -> A (winding -1), both marked for path X.
      </p>

        could potentially be acceptable? (Sort only if it is more than N splits in an edge?)
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-edgeSort">Edge Sort</h3>

      <p>
        We will sort our rational half-edges for the next stage (first by their starting point, then by their angle, then
        by their ID).
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Perhaps use MergeSort instead of RadixSort on GPU? Radix sort might need a lot of bits, and it seems like we would be
        doing 8 bits per pass?
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-filterConnect">Filter &amp; Connect</h3>

      <p>
        There are two goals here:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Combine otherwise identical overlapping half-edges together. Before this, each directional edge has one path
          that it is from, but now each half-edge will be from potentially multiple paths. We will combine the winding
          contributions into a winding map (path => winding) for these cases. (NOTE: we are currently duplicating effort
          for the reverse edges here). We will want to filter out duplicates (stream compaction on GPU).
        </li>
        <li>
          Connecting our half-edge structure together. Each half-edge already had a link to its "opposite" edge. However
          since we now have edges that are sorted by start THEN angle, we have effectively "ordered" all of the outgoing
          edges around each vertex, and thus we can store our "next" and "previous" half-edges if tracing
          counter-clockwise around the vertex. This will allow tracing of the edges in future steps.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notes: Monoid to scan edges, choose lowest index on each edge, propagate to the other edges. Presumably
        we should use half-edges for these data structures? (Should we be computing signed area in this pass?)
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-boundaryTrace">Boundary Trace</h3>

      <p>
        We will follow each half-edge until it loops back on itself. This will give us a boundary. It might be an
        "inner" or "outer" boundary. We can determine which it is by looking at the total signed area of the boundary
        (using the shoelace method). If it is positive, it is an inner boundary (is counter-clockwise), and if it is
        negative, it is an outer boundary (is clockwise). Outer boundaries are either (a) the outside of the bounding box
        or whatever region we have, or (b) a hole.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we have signed area here, we can discard all edges with boundaries with zero area.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the GPU, we will be able to use reduction techniques to make this efficient (like the linked list traversal).
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-faceHoles">Face Holes</h3>

      <p>
        Each inner boundary determines a face. We need to compute which outer boundaries are holes, and for which faces.
        Once we figure out which boundaries are holes for which faces, we can forget about whether they are inner/outer
        and just combine all of the relevant boundaries together to represent the face.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will first sort faces by their signed area. Then for each outer boundary, we will take the point on it with the
        smallest x value (compatible with our edge sort above), and we will scan for the smallest face that contains the
        point. We can filter a lot, ignoring faces smaller than the hole, faces whose bounding boxes don't fully
        (strictly) contain our hole, and we can take the smallest face that contains the point. Point-in-polygon testing
        is done with Dan Sunday's algorithm.
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Look up what paper most of the filtering techniques are from!
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of this, we will determine the "unbounded" outer face (the one that effectively contains the content OUTSIDE
        of the region we are rendering).
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-windingMaps">Winding Maps</h3>

      <p>
        We need to compute the winding map for each face. The unbounded face contains zero winding, so we can start with
        it and find adjacent faces (through edges). Each time we find an adjacent edge with one face that has a winding
        map and one that doesn't, we can compute the winding map for the face that doesn't have one (based on the
        information in the edge and in the one face).
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-renderProgramSimplification">RenderProgram Simplification</h3>

      <p>
        Our winding map for each face, combined with the winding rule for each path, gives us a boolean map (whether
        a path is included or not) for each face. In general these are sparse, so they will only mention the included
        faces. We can simplify the RenderProgram for each face by simplifying it with the path inclusion information
        (replacing each <code>RenderPathBoolean</code> with either the inside or outside RenderProgram), combined with
        simplification.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will precompute (possibly on the CPU) a replacement acceleration structure, since we will have many primitives
        that will simplify sparse path inclusion significantly. Thus if we have 1000 paths, and 3 of them are included
        in a face, we can create a simplified version of that RenderProgram without having to do a full scan of the 1000
        items. See <code>RenderPathReplacer</code> for more details.
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Write up RenderPathReplacer documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, many of the faces will have constant-valued RenderPrograms, which can be rendered much more efficiently!
        We won't have to do per-pixel blending at all in these cases.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stage-renderableFaceCreation">RenderableFace Creation</h3>

      <p>
        There now might be multiple faces that have equivalent RenderPrograms (especially those that are adjacent faces).
        Based on performance characteristics, we may want to do one of the following:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          Keep the faces separate
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Straightforward, but we will process more edges than needed.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Combine adjacent equivalent faces (just delete edges)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We can scan edges to find ones with equivalent faces on both sides. We can then discard these edges, and deliver
          edges out in the "unsorted edge" format (ideally edge-clipped) for future stages.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Combine adjacent equivalent faces (trace edges, skip equivalent)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          If we instead trace edges, and while traversing we skip over edges that have equivalent faces, we will generate
          polygonal data for each face. This will leave us with the best end-result, but might be more costly.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Fully combine all equivalent faces
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This could be done with "unsorted edges" or traced. We will get a full path for each RenderProgram, however
          depending on the rasterization method used, having two far-away small items in the same face could hurt
          performance.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="TODO">
        NOTE: This is better implemented by generating hashes for every simplified RenderProgram, so we can do quick
        comparisons. Find everywhere we are doing equality right now (probably somewhat inefficiently?).
        ONCE this is done, it will let us DAG RenderPrograms nicely on the CPU, if we store a hashmap of simplified
        programs? (Is that useful?)

        example, the <code>RenderDepthSort</code> for 3d meshes will be able to find exact split lines between different
        3d faces fully included in the RenderableFace. Additionally, for high quality output, gradients can split their

        THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG with RasterClipper's completed edge output. It's bugging up actual centroid computation.
        Create assertions on the "parallel" side for this to track it down.
        --- This disappeared?!?
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        IMPORTANT! Our resulting edge-clipped counts should be cyclic, right? Only use 2 bits per count!!
        They should wrap around or accumulate as long as we do arithmetic mod 4.
        Right now we are taking up 4x i32 for this, and that's (a) excessive, (b) killing performance, and (c) reducing
        the size of our potential workgroups.

        Is memory bandwidth (and the number of dispatches with memory reads/writes) killing performance?
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Performance seems to be very affected by the buffer sizes. Modify things so that we are working within the same
        buffer? I recall seeing a source saying they handle their own memory within a large buffer, instead of multiple
        buffers? See <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-memory-management">info</a>. Sub-allocation
        could be really efficient? How can we make sure our reads/writes are to the same area? Examine Vello approaches.
      </p>

      <p class="TODO">
        Alternative approaches, e.g. workgroup-per-initial-chunk? RenderProgram evaluation needs accurate edges
        unfortunately, and can use them in a linear way. NOTE: Maybe we can do a more efficient approach for the constant
        faces? (For instance, if we take the signed area of each edge, and accumulate that times the color, we do not
        have to do any cross-workgroup computation, and it is even more parallel). That does NOT work for RenderImage,
        or things where we really need the concept of "centroid" or face. We can't split up the centroid with that, since
        we need the full area in the first place to compute with (so we would have to have the input area for faces?) - that
        is technically possible.
